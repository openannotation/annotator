Alas! too soon,<br />We came aboard.<br />A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br />Before the always wind-obeying deep<br />Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<br />But longer did we not retain much hope;<br />For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br />Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br />A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<br />Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br />Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br />Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br />And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br />That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br />Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br />And this it was, for other means was none:<br />The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br />And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<br />My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br />Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,<br />Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<br />To him one of the other twins was bound,<br />Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<br />The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br />Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,<br />Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;<br />And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br />Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br />At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br />Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<br />And by the benefit of his wished light,<br />The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered<br />Two ships from far making amain to us,<br />Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<br />But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!<br />Gather the sequel by that went before.<br /></p>
