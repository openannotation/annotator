The quickstart guide for hacking annotator source!

# On a Mac
First install Homebrew from http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ 
Next install redo:

    $ brew install redo

# On Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
Building the packaged version of Annotator requires Avery Pennarun's excellent [redo build tool](https://github.com/apenwarr/redo).

    $ git clone git://github.com/apenwarr/redo.git
    $ cd redo && make install
    
# Then, once redo is installed

    $ redo                   # just build everything
    $ redo help              # show available build tasks
