# Public: Delegator is the base class that all of Annotators objects inherit
# from. It provides basic functionality such as instance options, event
# delegation and pub/sub methods.
class Delegator
  # Public: Events object. This contains a key/pair hash of events/methods that
  # should be bound. See Delegator#addEvents() for usage.

  # A jQuery object wrapping the DOM Element provided on initialisation.
  element: null

  # Public: Constructor function that sets up the instance. Binds the @events
  # hash and extends the @options object.
  #
  # element - The DOM element that this intance represents.
  # options - An Object literal of options.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   element  = document.getElementById('my-element')
  #   instance = new Delegator(element, {
  #     option: 'my-option'
  #   })
  #
  # Returns a new instance of Delegator.

  # Public: binds the function names in the @events Object to their events.
  #
  # The @events Object should be a set of key/value pairs where the key is the
  # event name with optional CSS selector. The value should be a String method
  # name on the current class.
  #
  # This is called by the default Delegator constructor and so shouldn't usually
  # need to be called by the user.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   # This will bind the clickedElement() method to the click event on @element.
  #   @options = {"click": "clickedElement"}
  #
  #   # This will delegate the submitForm() method to the submit event on the
  #   # form within the @element.
  #   @options = {"form submit": "submitForm"}
  #
  #   # This will bind the updateAnnotationStore() method to the custom
  #   # annotation:save event. NOTE: Because this is a custom event the 
  #   # Delegator#subscribe() method will be used and updateAnnotationStore() 
  #   # will not recieve an event parameter like the previous two examples.
  #   @options = {"annotation:save": "updateAnnotationStore"}

  # Examples

  #   # Listens for all click events on instance.element.
