Create two File Watchers.
1. The first would apply only to files in 'src' directory (and not it's sub directories) and would run
the make-annotator-js.cmd file. This file concatenates the source files and then compiles it into a single
annotator.js

2. The second File Watcher watches the files in the src/plugin directories and outputs to pkg/plugin
